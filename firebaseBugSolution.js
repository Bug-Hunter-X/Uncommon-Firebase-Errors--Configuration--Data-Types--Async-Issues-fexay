Always validate your Firebase configuration object to ensure all necessary fields (apiKey, authDomain, etc.) are present and correctly typed.  Use strict type checking (e.g., TypeScript) to prevent data type mismatches.  Always handle asynchronous Firebase operations using promises or async/await with proper error handling (try...catch or .catch blocks) to prevent silent failures.  For data type inconsistencies, implement input validation and data transformation to ensure correct data types are handled before passing them to Firebase.
