The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided configuration object is missing required fields or contains invalid values.  This often happens during initialization.  Another issue can be data type mismatches when interacting with Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.  For example, expecting a number but receiving a string.  Also, asynchronous operations without proper error handling (e.g., using promises or async/await without .catch() or try...catch) can lead to silent failures.
